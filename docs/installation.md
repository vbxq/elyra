# Installation

## Requirements

- **Rust 1.70 or later** - I use some newer language features
- **Cargo** - comes with Rust

## Pre-built Binaries

The easiest way to get started is to download a pre-built binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/vbxq/aelys_lang/releases).

Pick the binary for your platform and add it to your PATH.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbxq/aelys_lang.git
cd aelys_lang
cargo build --release
```

This takes around 20 seconds on a modern machine. The binary lands in `target/release/aelys-cli`.

Add it to your PATH for convenience:

```bash
# In ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/aelys_lang/target/release"

# Or create a symlink
sudo ln -s /path/to/aelys_lang/target/release/aelys-cli /usr/local/bin/aelys
```

For Windows, you can add it manually to your PATH via System Properties, or copy the aelys-cli.exe file to your directory of choice.

## Verifying Installation

```bash
aelys-cli version
# Aelys v0.17.9-a
```

Run the hello world example:

```bash
aelys-cli examples/hello.aelys
# Hello, World!
# Welcome to Aelys v0.17.9-a!
# Platform: linux (x86_64)
```

## CLI Reference

### Basic Usage

```bash
aelys-cli <file.aelys>              # run a source file
aelys-cli run <file.aelys>          # same thing, explicit
aelys-cli run <file.avbc>           # run compiled bytecode
aelys-cli compile <file.aelys>      # compile to bytecode
aelys-cli asm <file.aelys>          # show disassembly
aelys-cli repl                      # interactive mode
aelys-cli version                   # show version
```

### Flags

**Optimization**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-O0` | No optimization |
| `-O1` | Basic optimization |
| `-O2` | Standard optimization (default) |
| `-O3` | Aggressive optimization |

In practice, optimization levels don't make a huge difference for most code right now. The optimizer handles constant folding, dead code elimination, and some loop optimizations

**Output**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-o <path>` | Output file (for compile/asm) |
| `--stdout` | Print asm to stdout instead of file |

**VM Options**

You can tune VM behavior with `-ae.<option>=<value>`:

```bash
aelys-cli -ae.max-heap=128M program.aelys
```

`max-heap` sets the heap size limit.

**Development**

| Flag | Description                                                   |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--dev` | Enable development mode (for example experimental hot reload) |

### Examples

```bash
# Run with arguments passed to the program
aelys-cli program.aelys arg1 arg2

# Compile and save bytecode
aelys-cli compile main.aelys -o main.avbc

# Run compiled bytecode
aelys-cli run main.avbc

# View disassembly for debugging
aelys-cli asm main.aelys --stdout

# REPL with increased heap
aelys-cli repl -ae.max-heap=1G
```

## File Types

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `.aelys` | Source code |
| `.avbc` | Compiled bytecode |
| `.aasm` | Assembly (human-readable bytecode) |

Bytecode files are portable across machines with the same Aelys version. They skip parsing and compilation.

A `.avbc` records the `needs` lines its entry file declared, so running it imports the same modules the
source did, under the same names, whether or not the program qualifies them. The modules themselves are
not embedded: they are resolved beside the entry file, so a `.avbc` moved away from them will not run.

## Project Structure

Here's a sample project layout to explain module organization:

```
my_project/
  main.aelys           # entry point
  config.aelys         # configuration module
  lib/
    utils.aelys        # utility module
    http.aelys         # http helpers
  tests/
    test_utils.aelys   # tests
```

Modules are imported relative to the file that imports them. From `main.aelys`:

```rust
needs config
needs lib::utils
needs lib::http
```

There's no package manager or dependency system for now, just files and directories.

## Troubleshooting

### "cannot find module 'foo'"

Module resolution is relative to the importing file. Check:
- Is the file path correct?
- Did you spell the module name right?
- For `std.*` modules, make sure you're using the exact name (`std.io`, not `std.IO`)

You're trying to use file system operations without permission. Add `--allow-caps=fs` to your command.

### "error: expected X, found Y"

Parse error. Check:
- Missing braces?
- Typo in keyword?
- String not closed?

Error messages include line numbers. The compiler tries to be helpful but some messages could be clearer, soon (tm)

### "integer overflow"

You've exceeded the 48-bit integer range (±140 trillion). Use floats for larger values.. or refactor your code

### "invalid bytecode"

The bytecode file is corrupted or was compiled with a different Aelys version, try recompiling from source.

### The REPL is behaving weirdly

The REPL has some edge cases with multi

## Running Tests

If you want to verify the build:

```bash
cargo test
```

This runs the full test suite, there's 596 of them at the time of writing this (0.17.9-a).
